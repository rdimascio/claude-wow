// The child processes the bridge owns: an agent run per chat, and the capture
// script on the pixel transport. How they are started and how they are ended.
//
// On POSIX each child is spawned as the leader of its own process group
// (`detached: true`, which is setsid(2) and nothing else: the stdio pipes are
// wired exactly as asked, and the parent still waits for the child because
// nothing here calls unref()). That is what makes "kill this run" mean the
// whole tree: an agent that shelled out (a long `npm test`, a build) and the
// python capture script die with it, instead of surviving as orphans when a
// run times out or the bridge is stopped. Without a group of its own, a bare
// child.kill() reached the one process the bridge started and nothing under it.
//
// killTree ends a child's group with SIGTERM and, if it is still there after a
// grace period, SIGKILL. A child that ignores SIGTERM used to hold its stdout
// pipe open, so 'close' never fired, the chat stayed in `running`, and one of
// maxParallel was gone until a restart; now it is dead within the grace period.
// Windows has no process groups; `taskkill /T /F` kills the tree and is final.
//
// The bridge's own SIGINT/SIGTERM handler (bridge.js) runs killTree on every
// child it has, so Ctrl+C and `claude-wow service stop` strand nothing either.
// Detached children are not in the terminal's foreground group any more, so
// that forwarding is not a nicety: without it Ctrl+C would not reach them at all.
