# Linux (Wine) notes

The install itself is in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md): the one-line installer, or by hand with git. This page keeps what is specific to Linux: the session requirements, where the client lives, the background service under systemd, and how to check the screen capture.

The addon is the same as on Windows, and the default screenshot transport needs no capture at all: the addon calls `Screenshot()` and the bridge reads the file from the client's `Screenshots` folder inside the Wine prefix, where it also writes the slot files. `Screenshot()` under Wine is not yet confirmed by a live run, which is why the deprecated pixel transport is still here: `"mode": "pixel"` under `capture` in `~/.claude-wow/config.json` runs `bridge/capture_x11.py` (python3 + libX11 through ctypes, no packages to install) instead of `capture.ps1`. If the addon reports that it cannot shoot, the bridge falls back to it on its own and says so (`TRANSPORT FALLBACK` in the log, `/claude diag` in game). Please report either outcome.

## Requirements

- The game under Wine (Lutris, Bottles, a hand-made prefix...), **windowed or borderless**.
- Only for the deprecated pixel transport: an **X11** session (`echo $XDG_SESSION_TYPE` prints `x11`) and python3. Wayland blocks reading other windows' pixels; the default screenshot transport works there.
- At least one agent CLI logged in (see [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)). Nothing else with the installer on x64: it fetches the `claude-wow` binary, which has its runtime inside. Another architecture, or a checkout run by hand, needs Node.js 22.2+ (or Bun).

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rdimascio/claude-wow/main/install.sh | sh -s -- --project ~/path/to/the/project
```

Without `--wow`, setup looks in `$WINEPREFIX`, `~/.wine` and `~/Games/battlenet` for `drive_c/Program Files (x86)/World of Warcraft/_classic_beta_`; pass `--wow "<that folder>"` for anything else. By hand: `git clone https://github.com/rdimascio/claude-wow && cd claude-wow && node setup.js --wow "..." --project ...`, then `npm start` (`npm ci` is only needed to run the tests).

Then fully restart the game, enable *Azeroth Companion* on the AddOns screen, and either leave `claude-wow` running in a terminal or install the service.

## The service under systemd

`claude-wow service install` writes `~/.config/systemd/user/claude-wow-bridge.service` and runs `systemctl --user enable --now` on it: the bridge starts with your session and systemd restarts it after any exit. `claude-wow service status|logs|stop|start|restart|uninstall` wrap `systemctl --user`; the bridge's output goes to `~/.local/state/claude-wow/bridge.log` (`$XDG_STATE_HOME/claude-wow`), rotated at 5 MB, and `journalctl --user -u claude-wow-bridge` has the supervisor's own messages. The unit carries the `PATH` and `DISPLAY` you had when you installed it (the pixel capture needs `DISPLAY`; the screenshot transport does not), so re-run `claude-wow service install` after installing a new agent CLI. If you want the bridge up before you log in graphically, `loginctl enable-linger $USER`; it is not needed for the usual "starts when I log in".

## Check the capture (deprecated pixel transport only)

Log in, open the Azeroth Companion window and send any message, then while the strip of colored squares is in the top-left corner run:

```bash
npm run probe        # in the repo folder (~/.claude-wow/app with the installer)
```

It finds the game window, saves what the capture sees to `bridge/probe.png`, and prints whether it could decode a strip. If the picture is black or stale while the game shows the strip, the compositor is letting the game flip its own buffers. Try, in order:

1. `"keepComposited": true` under `capture` in `~/.claude-wow/config.json` (asks mutter/KWin to keep compositing the game window), then restart the bridge.
2. Plain windowed mode in the game settings.
3. `nvidia-settings -a AllowFlipping=0` (NVIDIA).
4. `"mode": "screenshot"` under `capture`: no capture at all, the addon screenshots the strip.
5. As a last resort `/claude config mode reload` in game: one UI reload per message.

The log shows `capture: attached to window 0x...` once the window is found. If it keeps saying `waiting for WowB window`, set `capture.processName` to your executable's name, or `capture.windowName` to part of the window title. `capture.python` picks the interpreter if `python3` is not the one on your `PATH`.
