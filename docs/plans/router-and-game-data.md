# Plan: trusted game data, then a model router, shipped as a Claude Code plugin

Status: draft, revision 3 (2026-09-30). Step 2 is built for wago.tools only (§4.3); QuestieDB is disabled. Code references name functions, not line numbers. **(unverified)** marks claims nobody has checked yet.

## 1. Goals and non-goals

**Goals**
- Answers about game content come from a local, versioned, cited dataset. The web comes last and is labeled.
- Game chats stop paying Opus prices for simple questions.
- The prompt surface moves out of `bridge/*.js` into one distributable plugin (skills and agents).
- Install and upgrade take one command per OS.

**Non-goals**
- No stored NPC data. Sightings is removed by PR #23 (`chore/remove-sightings`), which is a prerequisite and not part of this plan.
- No transport, map, macro or widget protocol changes.
- No hosted service. Data is fetched and cached on the user's machine.
- Data covers two games, one flavor each: Forever (`forever`, client 1.60.x) and Classic Era (`classic_era`, client 1.15.x, added in PR #49). The bridge picks the flavor from the client build in the `Game:` line and never falls back to the other one. No other game (retail, Season of Discovery, Anniversary) is in scope.

## 2. Order of work

Data first, router last. Each step must pay off on its own before the next one starts.

1. Pin a cheaper model for `ask` and measure (no new code).
2. Forever data sync.
3. `wowdata` MCP server, wired into `ask` runs by the bridge.
4. `wow-data` skill and prompt change, with a session reset.
5. Plugin with skills and agents. The router only goes in if step 1 to 4 numbers show a gain.
6. Installers, setup, doctor and docs.

## 3. Step 1: cheaper `ask` model, measured

- `agents.claude.model` and `agents.claude.extraArgs` already reach the `claude` argv (`agents.js`, `claude.args`). Try `claude-sonnet-5-5` for game chats through config first.
- A per-plugin override (`plugins.ask.model`) is added only if the owner wants `ask` and `claude-code` on different models.
- Measure with the real `claude` (`agentPath` set), not `dev/fake-claude.js`: 10 fixed prompts, cost and latency, against today's `opus[1m]`.
- Check `CLAUDE_RATES` in `agents.js` against the current price list in the same PR. Checked 2026-09-30: the Opus 5.5 rate was wrong ($5/$25, now $4/$20 with $0.20 cache reads).
- **Measured 2026-09-30** ([`measurements/step1-ask-model.md`](measurements/step1-ask-model.md), `dev/measure-ask.js`): one stable folder per model, as live `ask` runs use. The first turn of a new chat cost $0.233 on Opus vs $0.130 on Sonnet (1.8x, median 13.5 s vs 11.0 s). A resumed turn cost about the same on both: mean $0.031 vs $0.034, median $0.025 vs $0.016 (median 7.0 s vs 6.1 s). A cold first turn in a new folder cost $0.274 vs $0.212 (n = 1 each). New chats in a used folder still wrote about 26k cache tokens, so only resumed turns ran warm. The run stopped at its $3 budget after 6 of 10 prompts. Quality is for the owner to judge from the recorded answers; all of them use unverified game data. The default model is unchanged until then.

## 4. Step 2: trusted data for Forever

### 4.1 Sources

| Source | Gives | Risk | Freshness |
|---|---|---|---|
| wago.tools DB2 CSV, product `wow_cn_beta` | Client tables: `ItemSparse`, `TaxiNodes`, `QuestV2`, areas, `UiMap*` | wago.tools has no terms page. The real exposure is the Blizzard EULA on datamined client files **(unverified)**. Cache locally only; never commit or ship. | One build in its history so far (`1.60.1.70094`, 2026-09-29). The live client is already `1.60.1.70124`, so a mirror behind the client is normal. |
| QuestieDB `data/Forever/*` plus `src/corrections/Forever/` | NPC and object spawns, quest givers, objectives | **Disabled.** No license on GitHub (all rights reserved by default), and the maintainers have not given permission (decision 3). The sync does not fetch, parse or name it. | — |
| `Gethe/wow-ui-source`, branch `forever` | Blizzard UI Lua and API docs | Mirror of Blizzard code. Clone locally. | Tracks builds |
| warcraft.wiki.gg | API pages | CC BY-SA 4.0 (siteinfo API). Cache with attribution. | Live |
| Wowhead, other wikis | — | Never cached. Web fallback only, always labeled unverified. | — |

### 4.2 Sync

- `claude-wow data sync` is a new supervisor subcommand. It runs from install, from setup, from the weekly service timer, or by hand. **It never starts from game text.**
- (Disabled with QuestieDB, see §4.3.) QuestieDB files are Lua source. The sync parses Lua table literals with a data-only parser (`luaparse`, moved from devDependencies to dependencies and bundled in the binary). It never runs the Lua.
- Each row is checked on the way in: string length limits, coordinates numeric and within 0 to 100, IDs integers. A row that fails is dropped and counted in the manifest.
- Output: `<CLAUDE_WOW_HOME>/data/forever/<build>/` with JSONL per entity (`npcs`, `objects`, `quests`, `items`, `flightpaths`, `zones`) and `manifest.json` (`source`, `url`, `commit or build`, `fetchedAt`, `license`, `rows`, `dropped`).
- Coordinates are stored as `{uiMapID, x, y}` percent. QuestieDB zone coordinates are converted with the `UiMap*` tables.
- Atomic swap: the sync writes `<build>.tmp`, then renames it, and updates a `current` pointer. A lock file stops two syncs at once.
- Any build string used in a path or URL must match `^\d+\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+$`. The flavor is a fixed enum.

### 4.3 Step 2 status (built, wago.tools only)

- [x] `claude-wow data sync [--build] [--force]` in `bridge/datasync.js`, wired in `bridge/supervisor.js`. Reference: [CONFIGURATION.md, Game data](../CONFIGURATION.md#game-data).
- [x] Endpoints checked by hand on 2026-09-30: `https://wago.tools/api/builds` lists `wow_cn_beta` with one build, `1.60.1.70094` (2026-09-29). The site's route table names `db2/{table}/csv`, and `https://wago.tools/db2/<Table>/csv?build=1.60.1.70094` answers `text/csv` with `filename="<Table>.1.60.1.70094.csv"`. The sync refuses a file with any other name.
- [x] Tables: `ItemSparse`, `TaxiNodes`, `QuestV2`, `AreaTable`, `UiMap`, `UiMapAssignment`, plus `SkillLineAbility` and `SpellReagents` (R11: they were cheap, 0.4 MB and 0.3 MB).
- [x] `QuestV2` has only `ID`, `UniqueBitFlag` and `UiQuestDetailsThemeID`. Quest titles and text are not client data, so `quests.jsonl` holds IDs only.
- [x] Coordinates: `UiMapAssignment` rectangles turn `TaxiNodes` world positions into uiMap percent. Check: Orgrimmar comes out at 45.28, 63.75 on uiMap 1454 and The Sepulcher at 45.56, 42.42 on 1421. Zone rectangles overlap, so 65 of 100 flight paths sit in more than one zone. For those, `map` is the continent and `maps` lists every candidate. Picking the right zone needs area data the client tables here do not have.
- [x] R11 build family: the manifest stores `buildFamily`, a SHA-256 per table and `tableHash`; a second build in the same family records `previous.changedTables`.
- [x] First real sync (1.60.1.70094): 38,550 rows kept, 0 dropped. `items` 19,224, `quests` 6,605, `zones` 1,371, `flightpaths` 100, `uimaps` 60, `uimapassignments` 61, `skilllineabilities` 7,826, `spellreagents` 3,303. Before trimming edge spaces and allowing a reagent count of 0, 127 rows were dropped (7 names with a trailing space, 120 reagents with count 0).
- [x] Classic Era flavor (PR #49): `claude-wow data sync --flavor classic_era`, wago.tools product `wow_classic_era`, family `1.15.9`. The same endpoint shapes answer for it: `https://wago.tools/api/builds` lists `wow_classic_era`, and `https://wago.tools/db2/<Table>/csv?build=1.15.9.70003` serves each table. Every table and every column the parsers read is in the Era build, so no table is dropped for Era. First real sync (1.15.9.70003, fetched 2026-10-02T00:00Z): 39,234 rows kept, 0 dropped. `items` 24,442, `quests` 4,807, `zones` 1,212, `flightpaths` 87 (54 `zoneAmbiguous`, 1 on no map), `uimaps` 54, `uimapassignments` 55, `skilllines` 129, `skilllineabilities` 6,143, `spellreagents` 2,305.
- [x] Era checked by hand through `wow_item`, `wow_where`, `wow_flights` and `wow_sources` with client build 1.15.9.70003 (`buildCheck` `exact`, trust `client-data`): item 2589 is Linen Cloth (quality 1, item level 5, sells for 13 copper) and is a reagent for Tailoring (197), Engineering (202), First Aid (129) and Blacksmithing (164); Tirisfal Glades is uiMap 1420 under Eastern Kingdoms (1415) and area 85; uiMap 1420 holds flight path 11, Undercity, Tirisfal, at 61.2, 75.32 (`zoneAmbiguous`, so `map` is the continent); Brill has no flight path in Era, and the tool says so (`found: false`).
- [x] The ask prompt's link rule is the same on both games: an `{item:ID}`, `{spell:ID}` or `{quest:ID}` only from a "Linked from the game" entry or a wowdata row whose name is that item, never from memory, a website or a list of bare IDs.
- [x] Session reset on a system prompt change (§6), PR #61: the bridge records a hash of the rule text (the system prompt without the primer) when a Claude session starts, and starts a new session when it differs. A session from before the hash existed has none and keeps resuming.
- [ ] Run it from install, setup and the weekly timer (§8).
- [ ] NPC and object spawns: no source until a licensed one exists.

## 5. Step 3: `wowdata` MCP server

- `claude-wow data-mcp`, a stdio server. Tools: `wow_where`, `wow_quest`, `wow_item`, `wow_flights`, `wow_sources`. Each takes a name or ID and an optional `uiMapID`.
- Every row returns structured fields plus `source`, `build` and `trust` (`client-data`, `community-db`, `none`). Free text (names, quest text) is data in fields, never instructions.
- It reads the `current` pointer once at start and loads each table on first use, not all 10 MB up front. Each `ask` turn is a new process.
- **The bridge wires it, not the plugin.** For `ask` runs the bridge passes `--mcp-config` with the absolute path of its own binary and `alwaysLoad: true`. That avoids PATH problems (source checkouts have no `claude-wow` command) and keeps the tool name `mcp__wowdata__*`. Plugin-bundled servers are renamed `mcp__plugin_<plugin>_<server>__*`.
- **Permissions:** `ask` runs are `claude -p --permission-mode acceptEdits --allowedTools <config>`, and headless runs deny MCP tools that are not listed. The bridge adds `mcp__wowdata` as a run-only rule in code (`P.withRunOnlyRules`), so no user config change is needed. Test it in `tests/agents_test.js`.
- A client build newer than the cached one is expected. The server labels answers `build-mismatch` and the bridge logs it once. It does not trigger a sync.

### 5.1 Step 3 status (built)

- [x] `claude-wow data-mcp` in `bridge/datamcp.js` (MCP surface), `bridge/gamedata.js` (the store: `current` read once, tables on first use) and `bridge/gamerefs.js` (R1 tokens). Reference: [CONFIGURATION.md, The wowdata server](../CONFIGURATION.md#the-wowdata-server).
- [x] Adjusted to the data: `wow_quest` takes an ID only and returns `title: null`, because `QuestV2` has no titles. `wow_sources` is provenance (source, build, license, row counts, `notInData`), not drop sources: there is no drop data without QuestieDB. `wow_where` covers maps, areas and flight paths; it says NPC and object positions are not in the data. `uiMapID` is an input of `wow_flights` and `wow_where` only.
- [x] `SkillLine` added to the sync (154 rows on 1.60.1.70094) so `{skill:ID}` has names.
- [x] One `buildCheck` per answer: `exact`, `family`, `build-mismatch`, `unknown`, `no-data`. The client build comes from the `Game:` line of the situation block.
- [x] Wiring: Claude `ask` runs only (`runAgent(job, { gameData: true })`), and only when data is synced. No `--strict-mcp-config` (decision 5). `alwaysLoad` is a real stdio config key in Claude Code 2.1.286.
- [x] Proof on 2026-09-30: a real sync of 1.60.1.70094 (38,704 rows, 0 dropped), the server over stdio, and one headless `claude -p --model haiku --allowedTools mcp__wowdata --mcp-config …` run that called `wow_flights` with no permission denial and returned The Sepulcher (TaxiNodes 10) at 45.56, 42.42 on uiMap 1421.
- [x] R1 for orders and the roast card: orders go through `gamerefs.checkText` (tokens expand, unknown IDs refuse the whole order, the word allowlist runs on the rest); the roast card line takes no tokens and passes the same word allowlist.
- [x] Phrase check for orders and the roast card: 2 to 4 word runs against the synced names and `bridge/game-phrases.json`.
- [ ] Next: sync SpellName and creature names so the phrase check covers abilities and NPCs, and drop the hand-kept phrase list.
- [ ] Next: route reply text through `gamerefs` (R1), add `{npc:ID}` and `{quest:ID}` names when a source exists, and wire the server for the other agents (Codex `mcp add`) and the live session.

## 6. Step 4: `wow-data` skill and prompt change

- Superseded by PR #61: `WHERE_HINT` names the client's game and says the wowdata tools use only its data; `LINK_HINT` says where an item, spell or quest ID may come from. The `ask.js` `TOOLS` line was not changed.
- **Session reset:** Claude Code records a chat's system prompt at its first request and reuses it on resume (`--system-prompt-snapshot`, on by default). Existing chats would keep the old prompt. Built in PR #61: the bridge stores a hash of the rule text per session key (`sessionRules` in `state.json`; the primer is left out, so a primer edit still reaches only new chats) and starts a new Claude session when it changes, the same way it already does when the agent or plugin changes. Tests: `tests/bridge_test.js` and `tests/e2e/commands_test.js`.
- The primer stays in the system prompt. It is recorded once and prefix-cached, so it costs little, and every macro answer needs its Forever API rules.

## 7. Step 5: plugin, and the router if it pays

### 7.1 Plugin contents

- Skills and agents only. No MCP servers in the plugin: the channel server stays registered as today (user scope), and `wowdata` is wired by the bridge (§5) or registered at user scope by setup for live sessions. Nothing gets renamed.
- `ask` runs load it with `--plugin-dir <assets>/plugins/claude-wow`, so the plugin matches the bridge version with no user install. It was tried first through `agents.claude.extraArgs`; it now loads through `plugins.ask.claudePlugin` (§7.1.1).
- First, a one-run spike: `claude -p --plugin-dir … --output-format stream-json`, and read the tool, skill and agent lists. It answers whether `--plugin-dir` survives `--setting-sources` and whether subagent usage appears in the result's `modelUsage`.

### 7.1.1 Step 5 status (plugin built, opt-in; router not started)

- [x] Earlier work checked on 2026-10-05: `feat/ask-model-measure` is merged (PR #27, the §3 measurement). `feat/router-shadow` (PR #6, a TypeSafe Jev shadow router) and `feat/router-evals` (PR #9, stacked on it) are closed and not merged (decision 7); their worktrees are clean. The 183 labeled cases in `evals/router/cases.jsonl` on `feat/router-evals` stay the starting eval set for §7.2; nothing else there is reused.
- [x] Spike, Claude Code 2.1.285, $0.066 ([`measurements/step5-plugin-spike.md`](measurements/step5-plugin-spike.md)): `--plugin-dir` survives `--setting-sources` (empty, `user`, `project,local`) and `--strict-mcp-config`. Subagent usage is its own `modelUsage` entry and is in `total_cost_usd`. A relative `--plugin-dir` resolves against the run folder and fails with only a `plugin_errors` entry, so the path must be absolute.
- [x] Found in the spike: in `-p` mode subagents run in the background by default. The run emits two `result` events, a launch notice and then the answer; the bridge keeps the last one (pinned in `tests/e2e/plugin_dir_test.js`). `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_BACKGROUND_TASKS=1` makes them foreground (one result, one turn fewer); agent frontmatter `background: false` does not.
- [x] Plugin `assets/plugins/claude-wow` (agents only, no MCP server, no hook, no skill yet): `wow-code` (`sonnet`; `WebSearch`, `WebFetch`; the `wowmacro` contract) and `wow-planner` (`opus`; the nine `mcp__wowdata__*` tools only; the `wowmap` contract with no map file). The binary embeds it (`bridge/assets.js`), so a release has it on disk at `<home>/assets/assets/plugins/claude-wow`.
- [x] Loading, first try: config only, `agents.claude.extraArgs: ["--plugin-dir", "<absolute path>"]`. It reached every chat and factory Claude run, coding chats too, because the per-plugin block reads only `model` and `effort`; title runs never read `extraArgs`. A `--plugin-dir` still there is now named in one log line at start, and an `ask` run then gets only that one.
- [x] Loading, scoped (feat/ask-plugin-scope): `plugins.ask.claudePlugin: true` (default `false`, a non-boolean is ignored with one log line). `ask.js` passes `claudePlugin` to `core.runAgent`, and a Claude run then gets `--plugin-dir <AS.dir('assets/plugins/claude-wow')>`, an absolute path. Coding chats, factory runs and title runs never get it ([CONFIGURATION.md, The claude-wow Claude Code plugin](../CONFIGURATION.md#the-claude-wow-claude-code-plugin)). Pinned in `tests/e2e/plugin_dir_test.js` and `tests/plugins_test.js`.
- [x] `tests/plugin_test.js` (no `claude` CLI): manifest name and version, agents only, every plugin file embedded, explicit tools, no `Write`/`Edit`/`Bash`, no `WebFetch` for a wowdata reader, every MCP tool a real `wowdata` tool under `mcp__wowdata__`, and each contract example accepted by the bridge's own macro and map parsers.
- [x] Measured 2026-10-06, Claude Code 2.1.290, $0.298 ([`measurements/step5-plugin-spike.md`](measurements/step5-plugin-spike.md#wowdata-from-a-plugin-agent-2026-10-06)): `wow-planner` gets the parent's run-only `mcp__wowdata` rule. Its `wow_flights` call succeeded with `permission_denials: []`; a control run without the rule was denied. It used no `Write`, `Edit` or `Bash`, and its `wowmap` block passed the bridge's map parser. No config or bridge change. The plugin stays opt-in until the follow-ups below are done.
- [x] Known follow-up (PR #143 review), closed: the binary wrote plugin files only when something called `AS.file`/`AS.dir`. The bridge now calls `AS.dir` for the plugin path on every `ask` Claude run with `claudePlugin`. `AS.root` extracts the embedded set once per process, so the first such run after a bridge start writes the missing or changed files before it starts; later runs reuse that check.
- [x] Known follow-up (PR #143 review), closed (fix/plugin-followups): the claude parser reads init `plugin_errors` (measured shape `{ plugin: "inline[0]", type: "path-not-found", message, path }`), and the bridge logs one line per run. A background subagent run has two init events, each with the errors, so the line is logged once per run, not once per event. An existing folder with no manifest loads nothing and reports no error (measured).
- [x] Known follow-up (PR #143 review), closed (fix/plugin-followups): the parser skips `usage` and `model` of an `assistant` event with `parent_tool_use_id` set, so the context and model stay the main session's.
- [x] Known follow-up (PR #143 review), closed (fix/plugin-followups): `dev/fake-claude.js` prices the subagent at `claude-sonnet-5-5` rates with five-minute cache writes and a 1M window, the main model with one-hour writes and a 200k window, and emits the second init event of a background run; `tests/e2e/plugin_accounting_test.js` fails on the old window and cost.
- [x] Owner decision, foreground subagents: Claude runs of the `ask` plugin get `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_BACKGROUND_TASKS=1` (feat/ask-plugin-scope), so a subagent runs in the foreground and the run ends with one result. The bridge sets it for no coding, factory or title run (they use background Bash and Monitor); a value already in the bridge's own environment reaches every run. Pinned with `dev/fake-claude.js`, which runs `[[background-agent]]` in the foreground when the variable is set; not yet measured with the real plugin.
- [x] Bridge accounting with a subagent, closed (fix/plugin-followups): `claudeWindow` takes the main model's `modelUsage` entry (a `[1m]` suffix ignored; the largest only when no main model is known), and the cost is the result's `total_cost_usd` when `modelUsage` has every model at a listed rate (else the list-rate price, or tokens only). Measured 2026-10-06 on Claude Code 2.1.285, $0.029: the parser reported the CLI's $0.0292 and a 200k window; the old list-rate split gave $0.0318 (+9%) and the old window 1M.
- [x] Known follow-up (fix/plugin-followups review), closed: `/claude -r` on a session an `--inject` run made found it only in Claude Code's `projects/` folder, with no plugin, so it resumed as a coding run (an `ask` session with the plugin's tools in its snapshot ran without `--plugin-dir`), and the adopt recorded the plugin the message routed to, so the plugin-switch reset never fired. The second review found the record keyed by slot (lost on a second `--inject`), a no-record session saved as the routed plugin, no plugin on the addon chat after the first reply, and no plugin in the picker list. The plugin is now recorded by session id (`state.sessionPluginById`, `SS.madeByPlugin`, no record = `claude-code`), the adopt writes nothing, the session list carries the record, and the addon binds an adopted chat to its reply's plugin; pinned in `tests/e2e/plugin_adopt_test.js`.
- [x] New follow-up (fix/plugin-followups), closed (fix/mcpdown-and-gs-flake): a background subagent run has two init events, so `noteMcpDown` logged a down MCP server twice, and a coding run with the factory on whose factory server is down got that note twice. The bridge now handles the first `mcpDown` of a run only, like `plugin_errors`; pinned in `tests/e2e/factory_test.js`. `ask` runs are foreground and end with one result; their init count is not measured.
- [ ] §7.2 router: not started. It goes in only if measurements show a gain.

### 7.2 Router (only if §3 to §6 measurements show a gain)

- Delegation adds turns: classify and delegate, then compose, plus a fresh subagent context. For "where is X", one Sonnet turn with `wowdata` is likely faster and cheaper. So the router covers only the heavy kinds of work:

| Request | Agent | Model |
|---|---|---|
| Lookups (where is, drops, quest steps, flights) | none: the `ask` session answers with `wowdata` | `ask` model (§3) |
| Macro, addon Lua, API questions | `claude-wow:wow-code` | `claude-sonnet-5-5` |
| Leveling route, gear, talent or profession plan, multi-quest route | `claude-wow:wow-planner` | `claude-opus-5-5` |
| Explicit deep request, full addon design | `claude-wow:wow-deep` (opt-in) | `claude-fable-5-1` |

- Plugin agents are namespaced (`claude-wow:<name>`). The skill and the eval graders use the full names.
- Subagents do not get the parent's appended system prompt. Each agent file carries the output contract it needs (`wowmacro` and `wowmap` block formats, coordinates are uiMap percent), or loads it from a shared skill reference.
- Subagents get no `Write` and no map-file access. They return `wowmap` and `wowmacro` blocks, and the `ask` session copies them verbatim.
- Agents that read `wowdata` get no `Bash` and no `WebFetch`, so injected text in third-party data cannot run commands.

## 8. Step 6: install, setup, doctor, docs

- `install.sh` and `install.ps1`: after the binary and setup, run `claude-wow data sync` for Forever. Installing the user-scope plugin for live sessions is open decision 4.
- Homebrew: `caveats` prints `claude-wow setup` **(post_install sandbox limit unverified)**.
- Codex-only users (no `claude` CLI): skip the plugin; `wowdata` can be added with `codex mcp add`.
- Doctor: flags a missing or stale data cache and a plugin version that differs from the bridge. One version source: the git tag. `package.json` (0.4.0) and the Homebrew formula (0.5.0) already disagree; fix that first.
- Docs: `INSTALL*.md`, `LIVE-SESSION.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CONFIGURATION.md`.

## 9. Testing

- `npm test` stays free of the `claude` CLI. CI (`.github/workflows/test.yml`) has no Claude Code and no secrets. Plugin JSON and agent frontmatter are checked in plain node, including that every tool name in an agent file matches a real server name.
- `claude plugin eval` runs as a separate manual or secret-gated workflow with `--max-cost-usd` and recorded mocks for `wowdata`.
- Sync and server tests use fixture CSV and Lua files in `tests/`, with no network.

## 10. Risks

- **Licensing:** QuestieDB has no license; the EULA position on datamined client files is unverified. Fetch locally, never ship data.
- **Forever is pre-launch** (release 2026-11-04). Tables and the wago product key can change. Pin by build and commit.
- **Coverage gaps:** new Forever content is incomplete in QuestieDB. "I do not know" beats a wrong Classic proxy.
- **Third-party text:** names and quest text can carry prompt injection. Structured fields, validation at sync, and no Bash on data agents.
- **Cost:** a router can cost more than it saves. §3 measures first; §7.2 is conditional.

## 11. Decisions (2026-09-30)

1. The `ask` model is `claude-sonnet-5-5`, pending the step 1 measurement.
2. wago.tools client data is cached locally only, never committed or shipped.
3. Ask the QuestieDB maintainers for permission before step 2 ships QuestieDB data. Step 2 can start with wago data alone. Permission has not been given, so step 2 shipped with wago data alone (§4.3).
4. The installers offer the user-scope plugin and `wowdata` with a prompt; they do not install them silently.
5. `ask` runs keep inheriting the user's `~/.claude` setup for now. Revisit after step 1.
6. `wow-deep` (Fable) is opt-in behind config.
7. The TypeSafe router PRs (#6, #9) are closed. The 183 labeled cases in `evals/router/cases.jsonl` on branch `feat/router-evals` are the starting eval set for §7.2.

## 12. Ready to start: step 1

- [x] Set `agents.claude.model` to `claude-sonnet-5-5` in a test config (`dev/sandbox.js` with `agentPath` pointing at the real `claude`).
- [x] Run 10 fixed game prompts (where-is, macro, route, lore) on `opus[1m]` and on Sonnet 5.5. Record cost from the result's `modelUsage` and latency per prompt.
- [x] Check `CLAUDE_RATES` in `bridge/agents.js` against the current price list and fix it in the same PR.
